<div class="note tooltip" style="position: absolute" data-tooltip="saveViaFirebase">
    * Enabling will cause clicking "Save cache" to upload your cached data to Firebase and clicking "Restore cache" to download your posts from Firebase. Otherwise clicking "Save cache" will assemble a fileblob and download it while "Restore cache" will allow you to select a file containing cached posts which TumblrFox will attempt to parse and inject into the database.<br>
    <li>Advantages: Much more stable than assembling in the browser</li>
    <li>Drawbacks: Slow/sometimes unavailable due to data limits</li>
