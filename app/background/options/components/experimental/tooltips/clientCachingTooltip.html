  * Toggles caching via Tumblr's frontend.<br>
    WARNING: this will reset your cache!<br>
  <li>Advantages: faster post rendering, actual Tumblr html instead of reconstituted html via jquery, native/predictable Tumblr behavior, you don't have to reveal your likes to other users</li>
  <li>Drawbacks: significantly slower cache time than fetching from the API, timestamps are less accurate</li>
